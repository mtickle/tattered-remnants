Go back to a time of innocence and fun, a time when crudeness and violence were not part of the entertainment lexicon. Remember when school dances meant picking up your girl at her parents’ house and then cruising Main Street after. Record stores ruled the scene where you could spend hours lost in the music, both new and old and make new friends.

The weeks were school, part time jobs and sitcoms after supper. Saturdays meant meeting your buddies at the skate park and actually supporting those friends trying to do the tough tricks. Sundays were church, fellowship, chores, and then listening to new records with your headphones. 

There was still a sense of purity and our social media was talking to friends on the phone or passing notes during class. We didn’t see color and didn’t care about how good anyone was at any one thing because we were all playing the game of life together. They say that nostalgia is a potent drug, but let’s not think about how it used to be, and more like how we can make it like that again.   

This is the essence of Tattered Remnants. We’re upbeat and inspirational, but also not hiding from things like sadness, loss and heartbreak. Our songs are relatable tunes about life, love, work, and even overeating. Join us on our journey of just chilling out and bobbing your heads to the beat. And if you laugh or even cry, well, that’s okay too. Thanks for listening.

All tracks are purely demos and composed and exported from Guitar Pro 7. There's no vocals, but some words. Also, my mastering really sticks so you might want to turn down the bass a little.
